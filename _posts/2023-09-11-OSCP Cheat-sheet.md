While pursuing the OSCP 2023 version, I created a reference sheet that I nicknamed the 'OSCP Codex.' This reference sheet encompasses the commands and tricks I utilized during both the OSCP exam and the Proving Ground labs. I hope you find it helpful!

Due to the numerous pages, I'm unable to upload them here. However, you can access the OSCP Codex on the Gitbook site using the following link: [OSCP Codex](https://oscp-codex.gitbook.io/oscp-codex/)
