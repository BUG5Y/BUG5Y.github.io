<div class="w-100">
	<p>My name is Zach Reed, I'm currently a student at Southern New Hampshire University, studying a bachelorâ€™s degree in cybersecurity.
		I love pretty much all things offensive security and continue to pursue this passion through CTF platforms. I have mainly focused on web application security and active directory security but more recently I have been branching out mobile application security(mainly Android) and binary exploitation.
		Happy hacking!
